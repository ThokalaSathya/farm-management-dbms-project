# farm-management-dbms-project
Farmers face various challenges in managing day-to-day farm operations efficiently. Manual 
management methods can lead to errors, inefficiency, and a lack of visibility over key farm 
metrics. Additionally, farms need a centralized platform to handle operational data, track 
resource usage, and streamline processes. The lack of a digital solution often limits farmersâ€™ 
ability to make informed decisions, affecting crop yield, financial planning, and 
sustainability. 
The motivation behind this project is to create a robust, efficient, and user-friendly Farm 
Management System that consolidates farm-related data, automates routine processes, and 
supports real-time insights for farmers. By implementing this system, we aim to enhance 
resource management, improve productivity, and enable farmers to focus on strategic 
decision-making, ultimately contributing to sustainable farming practices. 
This project involves creating a functional application that manages product information 
through a MySQL database, with front-end code in HTML and backend database interactions 
via MySQL.
